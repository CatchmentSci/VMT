<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment">EDITFIGUREDIALOG opens a small GUI enabling users to set plot parameters
 this funtion creates an instance of a small GUI with plot configuration
 abilities. It is called in disableMenuBar.m by the hEdit handle, which is
 created whenever a Planview or Mean Cross Section plot is spawned in VMT.
